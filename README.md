## Getting Started

This version of eShop is based on .NET 9. 

Previous eShop versions:
* [.NET 8](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/tree/release/8.0)

### Prerequisites

- Clone the eShop repository: https://github.com/dotnet/eshop
- [Install & start Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### Windows with Visual Studio
- Install [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
  - Select the following workloads:
    - `ASP.NET and web development` workload.
    - `.NET Aspire SDK` component in `Individual components`.
    - Optional: `.NET Multi-platform App UI development` to run client apps

Or

- Run the following commands in a Powershell & Terminal running as `Administrator` to automatically configure your environment with the required tools to build and run this application. (Note: A restart is required and included in the script below.)

```powershell
install-Module -Name Microsoft.WinGet.Configuration -AllowPrerelease -AcceptLicense -Force
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
get-WinGetConfiguration -file .\.configurations\vside.dsc.yaml | Invoke-WinGetConfiguration -AcceptConfigurationAgreements
```

Or

- From Dev Home go to `Machine Configuration -> Clone repositories`. Enter the URL for this repository. In the confirmation screen look for the section `Configuration File Detected` and click `Run File`.

#### Mac, Linux, & Windows without Visual Studio
- Install the latest [.NET 9 SDK](https://dot.net/download?cid=eshop)

Or

- Run the following commands in a Powershell & Terminal running as `Administrator` to automatically configuration your environment with the required tools to build and run this application. (Note: A restart is required after running the script below.)

##### Install Visual Studio Code and related extensions
```powershell
install-Module -Name Microsoft.WinGet.Configuration -AllowPrerelease -AcceptLicense  -Force
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
get-WinGetConfiguration -file .\.configurations\vscode.dsc.yaml | Invoke-WinGetConfiguration -AcceptConfigurationAgreements
```

> Note: These commands may require `sudo`

- Optional: Install [Visual Studio Code with C# Dev Kit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/get-started)
- Optional: Install [.NET MAUI Workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?tabs=visual-studio-code)

> Note: When running on Mac with Apple Silicon (M series processor), Rosetta 2 for grpc-tools. 

### Running the solution

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to ensure that Docker is started

* (Windows only) Run the application from Visual Studio:
 - Open the `eShop.Web.slnf` file in Visual Studio
 - Ensure that `eShop.AppHost.csproj` is your startup project
 - Hit Ctrl-F5 to launch Aspire

* Or run the application from your terminal:
```powershell
dotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj
```
then look for lines like this in the console output in order to find the URL to open the Aspire dashboard:
```sh
Login to the dashboard at: http://localhost:19888/login?t=uniquelogincodeforyou
```

> You may need to install ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificates first, and then close all browser tabs. Learn more at https://aka.ms/aspnet/https-trust-dev-cert

### Azure Open AI

When using Azure OpenAI, inside *eShop.AppHost/appsettings.json*, add the following section:

```json
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "OpenAi": "Endpoint=xxx;Key=xxx;"
  }
```

Replace the values with your own. Then, in the eShop.AppHost *Program.cs*, set this value to **true**

```csharp
bool useOpenAI = false;
```

Here's additional guidance on the [.NET Aspire OpenAI component](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/azureai/azureai-openai-component?tabs=dotnet-cli). 

### Use Azure Developer CLI

You can use the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) to run this project on Azure with only a few commands. Follow the next instructions:

- Install the latest or update to the latest [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install).
- Log in `azd` (if you haven't done it before) to your Azure account:
```sh
azd auth login
```
- Initialize `azd` from the root of the repo.
```sh
azd init
```
- During init:
  - Select `Use code in the current directory`. Azd will automatically detect the .NET Aspire project.
  - Confirm `.NET (Aspire)` and continue.
  - Select which services to expose to the Internet (exposing `webapp` is enough to test the sample).
  - Finalize the initialization by giving a name to your environment.

- Create Azure resources and deploy the sample by running:
```sh
azd up
```
Notes:
  - The operation takes a few minutes the first time it is ever run for an environment.
  - At the end of the process, `azd` will display the `url` for the webapp. Follow that link to test the sample.
  - You can run `azd up` after saving changes to the sample to re-deploy and update the sample.
  - Report any issues to [azure-dev](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues) repo.
  - [FAQ and troubleshoot](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/troubleshoot?tabs=Browser) for azd.

### Sample data

The sample catalog data is defined in [catalog.json](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/blob/main/src/Catalog.API/Setup/catalog.json). Those product names, descriptions, and brand names are fictional and were generated using [GPT-35-Turbo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt), and the corresponding [product images](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/tree/main/src/Catalog.API/Pics) were generated using [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3).

## eShop on Azure

For a version of this app configured for deployment on Azure, please view [the eShop on Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopOnAzure) repo.

# <img width="24" height="24" alt="harness_favicon" src="img/harness_favicon.png" /> Harness Feature Management & Experimentation (FME)

This version of eShop includes a gRPC backend microservice that evaluates Harness FME feature flags.

To evaluate feature flags in code:
1. [Sign up to Harness for free](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup) and choose the Feature Management & Experimentation tile.
2. Find your [Harness FME server-side SDK API key](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-management-experimentation/api-keys?fme-split=fme) and take note of the associated **Environment**. For collecting RUM metrics, you will also need one client-side SDK API key.
3. On your machine, create an `FME_SERVERSIDE_SDK_KEY` environment variable (used by [FME .NET SDK](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/server-side-sdks/net-sdk)) and an `FME_CLIENTSIDE_SDK_KEY` environment variable (used by [FME Browser RUM Agent](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-agents/browser-rum-agent)) and set the values to be the server-side and client-side API key values. The FME microservice will use the server-side value for authentication.
4. Create two FME feature flags named `display_product_rating` and `display_discount`.
5. Create definitions for each feature flag in the FME Environment that matches your API key, as follows:
  - `display_product_rating` 
    - choose css color keywords as treatment names
  - `display_discount`
    - choose the percentage discount amounts (e.g. 30, 50, etc.) as treatment names
    - set up an attribute-based targeting rule: **`IF`** `city` `is in list` `new_york` (you can type 'city' and 'new_york' directly in the input boxes)

When the site is running, you will see feature flag impressions (evaluations) showing up on the **Live tail** tab of your feature flags or of Data Hub in Harness FME.

For implementation details, look in the repo commit history. If you have questions, reach out to us at support@split.io (the support email continues to be used by the team at Harness FME).

## Anonymous user login

This version of eShop allows users to add items to the cart before signing in to the eShop site.

### Coming Enhancements

There are some coming enhancements to provide a seamless user experience across user logins, when using FME feature flags. If you are interested in seamless feature flag evaluations and experimentation across user logins, add a watch to this repo.
